# About Me 🌟

Hi there! I'm Francesca, a curious soul constantly exploring the world, both literally and figuratively. This part of the repository dives into who I am outside the technical world. Spoiler alert: I love sports, traveling, staying informed, and giving back to the community!

## 🏀 My Love for Sports  
I grew up in a family of sports enthusiasts, and it’s safe to say that sports are part of my DNA. What excites me most about sports is the perfect mix of competition, solidarity, and the purest form of meritocracy.  

- **Basketball**: I played competitively for years, and later on, I transitioned into coaching—a deeply rewarding experience that taught me the value of teamwork and leadership.  
- **Skiing**: My one true love. Despite growing up far from the mountains in Bologna, I’ve always been drawn to the adrenaline, the fresh air, and the thrill of skiing—whether it’s solo or with friends.  
- **Tennis**: As a spectator, nothing beats tennis for me. It’s pure mental strength on display, and I can’t get enough of it!

## ✈️ Wanderlust Adventures  
I'm endlessly fascinated by how new places can shape our perceptions and emotions. Traveling isn't just about seeing beautiful sights (though those are a bonus!); it's about the feelings and instincts that arise when you're immersed in different environments.  
Here are a few snapshots of places that truly left a mark on me. 🌍📸

## 🎙️ Staying in the Loop  
As I said, curiosity fuels me, and one of my favorite ways to feed it is through podcasts. From history to geopolitics and daily news briefings, I love hearing people share their perspectives.  
Here are some of my go-to listens:  
- **History Buff?** Check out *Barbero's Tales*.  
- **Geopolitics?** Hannah's *Global Insights* is a gem.  
- **News?** I enjoy *Morning Rundown*, *NY Times Daily*, and *Mondo's Weekly Recap*.  

Have any podcast recommendations? Let me know—I’m always looking for the next great listen! 🎧

## 💙 Volunteering  
Recently, I had the opportunity to volunteer in flood-affected areas of my hometown, Bologna. It was a truly humbling and enriching experience—collaboration and solidarity are powerful forces. Moving forward, I plan to dedicate as much time as I can to volunteering. It’s a way of giving back that makes me feel genuinely useful.
