## **🧑‍💻 About Me**
Hi, I'm **Francesca Venturi**, a mathematical engineer passionate about using Machine Learning to solve real-world problems, especially in the biomedical field. I'm constantly seeking challenges that combine critical thinking and innovative technology.

*...But math isn't everything!* When I’m not working on models, you’ll probably find me skiing down a mountain — because even an engineer needs some downhill momentum... with a bit more adrenaline and a lot less debugging! ⛷️❄️
